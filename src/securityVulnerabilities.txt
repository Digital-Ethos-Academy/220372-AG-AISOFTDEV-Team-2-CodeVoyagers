Identified Security Vulnerabilities
- Cross Site Scripting
    - Risk: At the client side innerHTML usage, which means if any fields
      are user controlled, the chances of an attacker injecting scripts
      are high.
    - Possible Solution: Validation and sanitization of the user inputs
      before storing them.

- Local File Path Usage
    - Risk: Attacker could influence the file paths.
    - Possible Solution: Limiting file access to secure directories and not
      accepting raw filesystem path from the users.

- Unsafe Remote Fetches
    - Risk: Allowing access to internal resources or even causing the service
      to act a proxy.
    - Possible Solution: Before fetching, validating the URLs could help. Plus,
      using remote resources with strict limits/timeouts would also be benefical.

- Potential for Overwrite
    - Risk: Attacker can control the directory leading to overwriting files or 
      logs, especially those with special permissions.
    - Possible Solution: Avoiding defaulting to the project root and removing legacy
      behavior that enables the overwriting to happen.

- Exposure in Logs
    - Risk: Sensitive token information or secrets could be written in the logs.
    - Possible Solution: Avoiding logging full variable names and implementing
      secret keys or patterns (ex: API keys).
